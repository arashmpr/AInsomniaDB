# InsomniaDB 

In this project, I will try to create a mini database based on SQLite by following (Let's Build a Simple Database)[https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/]

The reason for doing this project is to learn about the underlying architecture of database systems and how to build one. Moreover, in the long run, I want to create an oblivious datastore that is highly scalable and has a high performance.

If you have any recommendation, please reach me at (here)[arashmdp@gmail.com]

Coming soon...

If you wish to run this database at this stage you can do the following:
1. git clone https://github.com/arashmpr/InsomniaDB.git
2. cd InsomniaDB
3. mkdir build && cd build
4. cmake ../ && cmake --build .
5. ./InsomniaDB

Let me know if there are any issues :)
