# AInsomniaDB 

In this project, I will try to create a mini vector database step by step.

The reason for doing this project is to learn about the underlying architecture of vector database systems and how to build one. Moreover, in the long run, I want to create an oblivious datastore that is highly scalable and has a high performance.

If you have any recommendations, please reach me [here](mailto:arashmdp@gmail.com)
