# InsomniaDB 

In this project, I will try to create a mini database based on SQLite by following [Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/)

The reason for doing this project is to learn about the underlying architecture of database systems and how to build one. Moreover, in the long run, I want to create an oblivious datastore that is highly scalable and has a high performance.

If you have any recommendations, please reach me [here](mailto:arashmdp@gmail.com)

Coming soon...

If you wish to run this database at this stage you can do the following:
1. git clone https://github.com/arashmpr/InsomniaDB.git
2. cd InsomniaDB
3. mkdir build && cd build
4. cmake ../ && cmake --build .
5. ./InsomniaDB

Let me know if there are any issues :)

Updates:
- I found a new blog from YCombinator which might come in handy in the future. [Letâ€™s Build a Simple Database (2017)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19581721)
